### Summary:
 
After removing Thomas High School's 9th grade class scores there were only minor changes to scores that included Thomas High School. As per the results above, there was little to no change to the other scores that incorporated other schools. Thom High School's own scores only changed minorly. This is likely due to the fact that the 9th grader's scores at Thomas High School were a small portion of the overall data, and was not large enough to make a large impact across the results
